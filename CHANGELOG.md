## Changelog

### Version 1.5.0:
- Added `maximise`, `fullscreen` and `remove_borders` to `window.py`.
- Added `*args` to all commands so that they can be bound to commands.
- Changed the `command` of most of the functions such as a `insert_radiobutton` to be activated with `ButtonRelease` instead if `Button`.
